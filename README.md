PROJECT DESCRIPTION								

The Success Stories Program highlights the success of Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) participants, mentors, and alumni in their programs, shining the spotlight on their host and sponsor agencies. Success stories illustrate how current and previous research participants have taken an active role in world-class science. Many of these internship, fellowship, and research appointments shaped their futures and professional goals. These stories are published on the corporate website, more commonly referred to as the Virtual Institute (https://orise.orau.gov/), featured on the company's social media pages to enhance business development, and will be promoted on the newly designed mobile application. The corporate website attracts 1,000 users daily and the multiple social media platforms reach a combined 7,000+ users. I have written 20 stories for the program, all in Associated Press (AP) style, and 8 are live links online. My stories have been used to promote exceptional scientific researchers, gain exposure for programs, and have been utilized in recruiting and outreach efforts including: tabletops, fliers, and brochures. My stories were also featured in the companyâ€™s 2018 annual report.
